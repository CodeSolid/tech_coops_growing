## CodeSolid

CodeSolid is an employee owned cooperative that creates software products, especially SaaS (Software As A Service) products, using a unique Employee Owned Source Code [approach](http://codesolid.com/employee_owned_source_code.html) and [license](http://codesolid.com/license.html). We are seeking developers at all skill levels with an interest in Python / Flask / Mongo / Angular stack to contribute to [Goalboost](http://codesolid.com/goalboost.html).  We're also open to other projects that may wish to locate fellow contributors under an employee owned source code license -- if there's something we can build together, let's discuss it! To learn more or get in touch with the team, please [subscribe](mailto:codesolid-subscribe@yahoogroups.com) or [post a message](mailto:codesolid@yahoogroups.com) to our company email list.

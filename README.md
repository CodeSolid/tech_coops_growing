## CodeSolid

CodeSolid is an employee owned cooperative that creates software products, especially SaaS (Software As A Service) products, using a unique Employee Owned Source Code [approach](http://codesolid.com/employee_owned_source_code.html) and [license](http://codesolid.com/license.html). We are seeking developers at all skill levels with an interest in Python / Flask / Mongo / Angular stack to contribute to [Goalboost](http://codesolid.com/goalboost.html).  We're also open to other projects that may wish to locate fellow contributors under an employee owned source code license -- if there's something we can build together, let's discuss it! To learn more or get in touch with the team, please [subscribe](mailto:codesolid-subscribe@yahoogroups.com) or [post a message](mailto:codesolid@yahoogroups.com) to our company email list.

## [Snowdrift.coop](https://snowdrift.coop)

Snowdrift.coop is a *multi-stakeholder* (aka *solidarity*) co-op web platform being built to provide a more cooperative and effective funding system for public goods. Public goods are those which everyone can share without limit and without exclusion such as free/libre/open software, music, art, research, and so on. An ethical democratic economy should not accept the artificial restrictions that turn public goods into exclusive club goods, but we still need ways to fund the work that goes into development. Snowdrift.coop provides a web platform for independent free/libre/open projects to get patronage support from the community via a pledge: patrons agree to fund the projects they like by donating a base amount per the number of total patrons (for example, donating $1 per month for every 1,000 patrons who donate with me). As a co-op, anyone funding the site itself can be a member, and members are split into three classes: the workers who develop the platform, the people who get funded to work on their independent projects, and the general patrons who only donate. As of 2015, Snowdrift.coop is still a work-in-progress accepting startup donations and volunteer help to get the system running.
